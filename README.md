Man, I’m tired of everyone laughing at me for calling myself an HTML programmer. I’m sure many are in the same boat as me, you included - don’t try to deny it. 

So I decided to show the beauty of this complex language, by adding those boring bits of so-called "essential building blocks for a valid programming language", just to silence the haters. 

I'm sure this will serve as a turning point in the evolution of the entire industry. Perchance.
